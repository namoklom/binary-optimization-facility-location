## üìå Overview

This project tackles a **Binary Optimization Problem** in the context of **Facility Location Planning**. The aim is to determine **which potential store location(s)** a company should open to **minimize the total transportation cost** while ensuring **every customer is served by exactly one store**.

The project is implemented using:

- **Python** with the **PuLP** linear programming library
- **Microsoft Excel Solver** (as an alternative method)

## üß† Problem Statement

A retail company has identified **five possible store locations** (L1‚ÄìL5) and serves **twenty customers** (C1‚ÄìC20). The company wants to decide **which store(s) to open** such that:

- Each customer is assigned to **exactly one** store.
- The **total transportation cost** from stores to customers is **minimized**.

This problem falls under the category of **combinatorial optimization** and is solved using **Binary Integer Programming (BIP)**.
